Each breed must be seperated by commas. Preferrably, the breed is given as it's ID. This is the first 4 letters of the breed name, unless the breed contains 2 words; in this case the ID is the first letter of the first word and then the first 3 letters of the second word. For example: Maine Coon is mcoo, British Shorthair is bsho, Bengal in beng. If the ID is not given in the correct format, the bot will try to get it into the right format but may not work.
